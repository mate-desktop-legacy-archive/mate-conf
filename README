MateConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the MATE
desktop but does not require MATE; configure should notice if MATE
is not installed and compile the basic MateConf library anyway.

MateConf does require glib and MateCORBA.  It has optional ldap and xml backends
that require openldap and libxml respectively.
